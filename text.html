    <p>Dear {name} team,</p>
    <p>As a Europe-based fintech startup, we’ve long admired your role in shaping Europe’s tech ecosystem. With 1,136+ investments and 53 exits, your track record of backing bold innovation has been a real inspiration to us at Montreux Financial.</p>
    <p> However, we noticed a gap in the European Banking System. </p>
    <p> Did you know that despite having 4,886 traditional banks in Europe, there are only 77 neobanks that are serving a rapidly growing segment of digital-native consumers, freelancers, and SMEs? </p>
    <p> This leaves users juggling multiple disconnected apps for banking, crypto, and investing—an outdated experience in a digital-first world. </p>
    <p> We are determined to fill this gap. Montreux Financial is a next-gen, AI-powered neobank built in Spain for Europe. We unify: </p>
    <ul>
      <strong> <li> Instant IBAN accounts + debit cards </li></strong>
      <strong> <li> Real-time crypto trading with AI portfolio optimization </li></strong>
      <strong> <li> Fractional investing in stocks, commodities, and digital assets </li></strong>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is an all-in-one unified, <strong> mobile-first platform. </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re targeting a €500B+ converging market and are already in discussions with EU regulators. Our team has fintech expertise —including a previous exit—and we’re currently raising a €380K pre-seed round to complete development and launch.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’d love to explore if Montreux aligns with Wayra’s thesis. Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week?

    <p> Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. </p>
